# Cave Man (Offline Detection)

Detecting network online/offline events, with pure vanilla JavaScript.

## Usage

Open the `index.html` file in your web browser, it likely won't work with the `file://` protocol (dragging and dropping into your browser). You should use a development server such as [`serve`](http://npm.im/serve) to serve the files locally, otherwise just browse to it in this repo's GitHub Pages instance.
